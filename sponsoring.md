## Contributing to the SceneView Projects

### Thank you for your interest in supporting our work!

SceneView are open source projects freely available under the GPL and developed by a dedicated team of passionate individuals.
Your contributions help support our developers and fund equipment purchases for easier testing and development.
They also go towards software licenses and other project expenses such as website and server hosting.

It's important to us that SceneView is available free without advertisements and your contributions make that possible!

If you're a developer looking to get involved with the project directly please view our contributing guidelines on GitHub or visit our [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/UbNDDBTNqb).

# FOCUSED_SPOTLIGHT

[FOCUSED_SPOTLIGHT](index.md)

The same as a spotlight with the exception that the apparent lighting stays the same as the cone angle changes. A spotlight has a position and a direction. Use [setInnerConeAngle](../../set-inner-cone-angle.md) and [setOuterConeAngle](../../set-outer-cone-angle.md) to control the cone size.

# SPOTLIGHT

[androidJvm]\
[SPOTLIGHT](index.md)

Similar to a point light but radiating light in a cone rather than all directions. Note that as you make the cone wider, the energy is spread causing the lighting to appear dimmer. A spotlight has a position and a direction. Use [setInnerConeAngle](../../set-inner-cone-angle.md) and [setOuterConeAngle](../../set-outer-cone-angle.md) to control the cone size.

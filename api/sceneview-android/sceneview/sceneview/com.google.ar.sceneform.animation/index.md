| Name | Summary |
|---|---|
| [AnimatableModel](-animatable-model/index.md) | [androidJvm]<br>interface [AnimatableModel](-animatable-model/index.md)<br>An AnimatableModel is an object whose properties can be animated by an [ModelAnimation](-model-animation/index.md). |
| [ModelAnimation](-model-animation/index.md) | [androidJvm]<br>open class [ModelAnimation](-model-animation/index.md)<br>An ModelAnimation is a reusable set of keyframe tracks which represent an animation. |
| [ModelAnimator](-model-animator/index.md) | [androidJvm]<br>open class [ModelAnimator](-model-animator/index.md)<br>This class provides support for animating an [AnimatableModel](-animatable-model/index.md)Usage By default the [ModelAnimator](-model-animator/index.md) can play the full [ModelAnimation](-model-animation/index.md) starting from 0 to the animation duration with: [ofAnimation](-model-animator/of-animation.md) If you want to specify a start and end, you should use: [ofAnimationTime](-model-animator/of-animation-time.md)[ofAnimationFrame](-model-animator/of-animation-frame.md)[ofAnimationFraction](-model-animator/of-animation-fraction.md)Use casesSimple usage On a very basic 3D model like a single infinite rotating sphere, you should not have to use [ModelAnimator](-model-animator/index.md) but probably instead just call: [animate](-animatable-model/animate.md)Single Model with Single Animation If you want to animate a single model to a specific timeline position, use: [ofAnimationTime](-model-animator/of-animation-time.md)[ofAnimationFrame](-model-animator/of-animation-frame.md)[ofAnimationFraction](-model-animator/of-animation-fraction.md)<br>- A single time, frame, fraction value will go from the actual position to the desired one - Two values means form value1 to value2 - More than two values means form value1 to value2 then to value3<br>*Example:*ModelAnimator.ofAnimationFraction(model, "VerticalTranslation", 0f, 0.8f, 0f).start();Single Model with Multiple Animations If the model is a character, for example, there may be one ModelAnimation for a walkcycle, a second for a jump, a third for sidestepping and so on. |

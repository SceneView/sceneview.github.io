###  Camera facing direction filter

Currently, a back-facing (world) camera is guaranteed to be available on all ARCore supported devices. Most ARCore supported devices also include support for a front-facing (selfie) camera. See [ARCore supported devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices) for available camera configs by device.

The default value is CameraConfig.FacingDirection.BACK
